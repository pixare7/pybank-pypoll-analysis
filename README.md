## Project Description

### PyBank
The PyBank project analyzes a financial dataset to calculate key metrics such as total months, net profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits. It provides a comprehensive financial analysis both in the terminal and as a written text file.

### PyPoll
The PyPoll project analyzes election data to calculate the total number of votes, votes per candidate, the percentage of votes each candidate received, and determines the winner of the election. The results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file.
